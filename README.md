# ü¶¥ **ADLM: Addressing Class Imbalance in Bone Tumor X-Ray Classification with Generative Models**

This project explores how **generative models** can help address **class imbalance** in **bone tumor X-ray classification**.  
We use the **BTXRD dataset**, which contains X-ray images of different primary bone tumor entities.

## **üéØ Project Goals**

- Implement a **ResNet-based CNN** as a **baseline model** for tumor classification.  
- Apply and analyze **class imbalance handling techniques** such as **Weighted Loss**, **Focal Loss**, and **Data Augmentation**.  
- Use **generative models** (e.g., **GANs** or **Diffusion Models**) to create synthetic X-ray images and evaluate their impact on classification performance.

## **ü¶¥ Target Tumor Types**

We focus on classifying **seven tumor types**:

- Osteochondroma  
- Osteosarcoma  
- Multiple Osteochondromas  
- Simple Bone Cyst  
- Giant Cell Tumor  
- Synovial Osteochondroma  
- Osteofibroma

## **üè´ About the Project**

This project is part of the **Advanced Deep Learning Methods (ADLM)** course at the  
**Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, in collaboration with the  
**Clinic for Orthopaedics and Sports Orthopaedics** and the  
**Institute for AI and Informatics in Medicine**.

ðŸ¦´ ADLM: Addressing Class Imbalance in Bone Tumor X-Ray Classification with Generative Models

This project explores how generative models can help address class imbalance in bone tumor X-ray classification.
We use the BTXRD dataset, which contains X-ray images of different primary bone tumor entities.

Our goals are to:
	1.	Implement a ResNet-based CNN as a baseline model for tumor classification.
	2.	Apply and analyze class imbalance handling techniques such as Weighted Loss, Focal Loss, and Data Augmentation.
	3.	Use generative models (e.g., GANs or Diffusion Models) to create synthetic X-ray images and evaluate their impact on classification performance.

We focus on classifying seven tumor types:
Osteochondroma, Osteosarcoma, Multiple Osteochondromas, Simple Bone Cyst, Giant Cell Tumor, Synovial Osteochondroma, and Osteofibroma.

This project is part of the Advanced Deep Learning Methods (ADLM) course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM),
in collaboration with the Clinic for Orthopaedics and Sports Orthopaedics and the Institute for AI and Informatics in Medicine.
